  <h1>The Order of the Ætherwright</h1>
  <p>A symbolic token system for classifying authored content across phases, domains, and cognitive states.</p>
  <p class="tagline">A symbolic and philosophical framework for intentional creation and cognitive clarity.</p>

  <!-- What It Is -->
  <section class="what-it-is">
    <h2>What is the Order of the Ætherwright?</h2>
    <p>The Order is a conceptual scaffolding for projects, processes, and authored systems. It uses glyphs, domains, and ritualized design logic to encode intent, trace progress, and clarify the invisible structures behind meaningful work. It’s part taxonomy, part philosophy, part semantic toolkit.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Why It Matters -->
  <section class="why-it-matters">
    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>Creative systems often suffer from entropy and abstraction. The Order brings language, iconography, and semiotic structure to the forefront—making invisible dynamics explicit. It helps individuals and teams reflect, track, and refine their thinking with symbolic precision.</p>

  <!-- How It Works -->
  <section class="how-it-works">
    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Glyph System:</strong> Each glyph maps to a cognitive or creative domain, like research, refinement, or publication.</li>
      <li><strong>Symbolic Sessions:</strong> Projects are annotated with glyphs and tags that track progress and intent over time.</li>
      <li><strong>Semantic Codex:</strong> Terms, definitions, and icons are codified for use across Savepoints, journals, and systems.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- Who It's For -->
  <section class="who-its-for">
    <h2>Who It's For</h2>
    <p>Writers, designers, developers, researchers, educators, and self-reflective builders who want to embed clarity and recursion into their workflows—without adopting someone else’s framework wholesale.</p>
  </section>
