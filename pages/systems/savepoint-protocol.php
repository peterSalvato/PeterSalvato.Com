    <!-- What It Is -->
    <section class="what-it-is">
      <h2>What is Savepoint Protocol?</h2>
      <p>The Savepoint Protocol is a structured system designed to capture, index, and maintain cognitive checkpoints—critical moments of clarity and insight—making them effortlessly accessible for future reference and context.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Why It Matters -->
    <section class="why-it-matters">
      <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
      <p>In complex cognitive work, clarity can be fleeting. Without structure, valuable insights become lost or obscured over time. Savepoint Protocol directly addresses this, ensuring meaningful ideas and critical decision points remain clear, contextually rich, and permanently retrievable.</p>
