      <h2>Bio</h2>
      <p>I’m a cognitive systems designer with over a decade of experience leading UI/UX architecture, internal tools, and platform logic at enterprise scale. My background blends design thinking, information theory, and self-authored tooling—resulting in creative systems that scale meaning without sacrificing nuance.</p>

      <p>As lead front-end engineer and UI architect at Cluen Corporation, I created the JavaScript namespace and internal front-end framework used by full-stack engineers supporting Fortune 100 executive search clients. I also built internal design tools to improve onboarding, extensibility, and team autonomy.</p>

    <!-- Personal Philosophy -->
    <section class="philosophy">
      <h2>Philosophy</h2>
      <p>I believe systems should be recursive, readable, and resilient. I’m interested in how we structure knowledge across time—how clarity survives context collapse, and how we design interfaces that make semantic meaning visible.</p>

      <p>This site, and the protocols behind it, are my working response to those questions.</p>
