## Anchor

Writers track code better than memory. Treat every reflection as a commit: Savepoint turns messy fragments into an evolving personal repository—no more lost context.

## Tone

Diary‑meets‑DevOps; candid, slightly irreverent.

## Guiding Questions

1. Pain story: losing insight in endless Notes app scroll.
2. How Savepoint CLI makes “git commit” for thoughts.
3. Surfacing latent patterns across months of fragments.
4. Personal win: resurrected idea → finished song / design.
5. How any reader can start a 3‑folder, zero‑code workflow today.
