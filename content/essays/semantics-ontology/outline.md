## Anchor

Naming isn’t semantics—it’s governance. This essay walks from philosophical first principles to a linter rule, proving ontology work pays operational dividends.

## Tone

Shop‑floor philosopher: cite Quine once, then ship code.

## Guiding Questions

1. Distinguish data, information, knowledge, wisdom in one paragraph.
2. Why do teams re‑argue the same concept under new names?
3. How Validator enforces semantic contracts at commit time.
4. Success metric: bug / rework reduction post‑taxonomy adoption.
5. How to start an ontology without a PhD (practical checklist).

## Visual Storyboard

| # | Hook | Visual? | Sketch | Filename |
|---|------|---------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Semantics stack | ✅ | D → I → K → W pyramid | assets/diagrams/semiotic-pyramid.svg |
| 2 | Validator rule | ✅ | YAML + type checker output | assets/clips/validator-schema.mp4 |
| 3 | Before/after concept mapping | ✅ | Duplication vs unified term tree | assets/diagrams/ontology-reduction.svg |

## Impact Callouts

- Cut taxonomy collisions in frontend code by 70%
- Improved design handoffs by enforcing shared definitions
