title: "Cognitive Durability: A Punk Protocol for Human Memory in the AI Moment"
slug: "cognitive-durability"

## Anchor

Most insights die quietly—in half‑filled notebooks, forgotten Slack channels, abandoned research drives, and wiped AI threads. *Cognitive Durability* reframes knowledge work as a fight against entropy: a practice that spans handwritten journals, team chats, and LLM transcripts, treating every medium as fuel for a living, cross‑temporal memory system. Savepoint is not an AI tool—it’s a punk protocol for human memory that leaves a fingerprint of authorship, even when the platform shifts.

## Tone

Gritty Brooklyn workshop meets systems manifesto—direct, clever, and a dash of rebellion.

## Guiding Questions

1. Where do ideas vanish today? (journals, Notion, Slack, AI logs)
2. Why isn’t backup the same as durability?
3. What’s a human-first indexing schema—and why does it matter?
4. How does Savepoint protect against black-box AI loss?
5. How does durability help onboarding, project recovery, auditability?
6. How do you start with 3 folders and 1 CLI tool?
