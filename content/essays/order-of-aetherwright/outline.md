title: "Order of the Ætherwright: A Living Ontology for Creative Practice"
slug: "order-of-aetherwright"

## Anchor

Creative systems fail when taxonomy is an afterthought. The *Order of the Ætherwright* supplies glyph‑based scaffolding that evolves with the work—ritual meets version control.

## Tone

Mythic but grounded; Pollock drip + shop‑bench sawdust. Show doctrine, don’t preach it.

## Guiding Questions

1. Origin story: why invent a glyphic ontology?
2. Core mechanics: domain · intensity · type triad.
3. How glyphs act as tags, loci, and contracts simultaneously.
4. Case vignette: applying a glyph to a live project and watching scope clarify.
5. How the Order interfaces with Savepoint & Validator (symbolic compliance).

## Visual Storyboard

| # | Hook | Visual? | Sketch | Filename |
|---|------|---------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Overview of glyph system | ✅ | Domain × Intensity grid | assets/diagrams/glyph-grid.svg |
| 2 | Lifecycle loop | ✅ | Savepoint + Glyph + Reflection arrows | assets/diagrams/order-loop.svg |
| 3 | Use in real project | ✅ | Screenshot of annotated Savepoint index | assets/clips/aether-project-demo.mp4 |

## Impact Callouts

- Refined team taxonomy using glyphs across 5 live projects
- Designers reported faster alignment in critiques after applying visual glyphs
