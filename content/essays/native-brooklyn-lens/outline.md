## Anchor

Gentrified minimalism misses the signal graffiti captures. A native Brooklyn lens decodes street‑level semiotics and folds them into resilient, human design.

## Tone

Tom Waits voiceover on a G train: gritty, witty, affectionate.

## Guiding Questions

1. What can a bodega sign teach a SaaS onboarding flow?
2. Contrast transplant vs. native typographic cues.
3. Case: Chainprinter font choice & why grit matters for memory.
4. Danger of “universal” aesthetics—erasure vs. inclusivity.
5. Takeaway practices: field‑walks, vernacular scrapbooks, naming audits.
