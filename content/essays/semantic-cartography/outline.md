## Anchor

Most corporate knowledge lives in chat logs nobody can traverse. Semantic Cartography turns that dark corpus into a navigable map—threads, themes, time, and lineage one click away.

## Tone

Explorer’s log; tactile language (map, compass, trail).

## Guiding Questions

1. Define “dark corpus” and why search fails it.
2. Extraction layer: how we split raw chat into atoms.
3. Index layer: session→topic→pattern graph.
4. Visual layer: quick prototypes (Obsidian, VSC, custom React).
5. Impact: decision‑trace audit & idea resurfacing stories.

## Visual Storyboard

| # | Hook | Visual? | Sketch | Filename |
|---|------|---------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Raw vs mapped view | ✅ | Screenshot pair (chat log vs semantic graph) | assets/clips/chat-vs-map.mp4 |
| 2 | Extraction pipeline | ✅ | Text → tokens → concepts → index | assets/diagrams/cartography-pipeline.svg |
| 3 | Pattern resurfacing | ✅ | Heatmap + highlighted return insight | assets/diagrams/pattern-resurface.svg |

## Impact Callouts

- Recovered feature concept lost in Slack 6 months earlier
- Showed 3-year concept lineage during client onboarding
