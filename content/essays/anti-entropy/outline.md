title: "Anti-Entropy Workflows: Designing for Drift Detection"
slug: "anti-entropy"
---

## Anchor

Every standard decays unless someone—or something—polices it. Anti‑Entropy Workflows show how the Validator’s drift‑detection hooks keep structure honest at scale.

## Tone

Operations manual meets rebel field guide.

## Guiding Questions

1. Define structural drift in plain English.
2. “Forbidden drift” vs. “evolutionary drift.”
3. Daily vs. weekly checks: balancing friction & vigilance.
4. Rollout story: hooking Validator into CI, Slack digest, owner routing.
5. Early metrics: drift incidents cut by X%, merge time down Y%.

## Visual Storyboard

| # | Hook | Visual? | Sketch | Filename |
|---|------|---------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Drift alert snapshot | ✅ | Screenshot of failing rule | assets/clips/drift-alert.png |
| 2 | YAML config | ✅ | Validator rule snippet | assets/diagrams/validator-config.svg |
| 3 | Before/after ticket metrics | ✅ | Bar chart | assets/diagrams/drift-metrics.svg |

## Impact Callouts

- Reduced review times by 25% using automated drift flags
- Detected silent regressions 2 weeks before team surfaced them
